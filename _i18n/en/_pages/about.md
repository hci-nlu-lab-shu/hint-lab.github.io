Welcome to the H!NT (**H**uman-machine **I**nteraction & **N**a**T**ural language understanding) Lab! H!NT is a research laboratory newly created in 2023, and is headed by Professor [Pinpin Zhu](https://hint-lab.github.io/people/zhu_pinpin), collaborated with Assistant Professor [Hao Wang](https://hint-lab.github.io/people/wang_hao). We are primarily based at [School of Computer Engineering and Science (CES)](https://cs.shu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/) .


**Research synopsis**: Our principal research interests lie in the development of deep learning and cognitive methodology, and large-scale computational system and architecture, for solving problems involving human-machine communication, natural language processing, and multimodal media or documents in state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) systems.


The laboratory focuses on cutting-edge issues in the implementation of artificial intelligence in industries, fosters a strong academic atmosphere, and provides a research environment that is relatively free and flexible. The laboratory also has ample computing resources. 

Currently, the majority of members in the laboratory have a background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but we also welcome students with interdisciplinary backgrounds in fields such as psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, and more to join the laboratory.


**Open Positions**

From 2023.10, we are seeking ambitious and highly talented PhD (1) /Master (4) candidates to work on the interface of multimodal document retrieval (MDR), natural language understanding (NLU) using large language models (LLM).
